# NashDev Level Up Reading List
This is a repository dedicated to organizing and maintaining reading material
for the [NashDev Level Up Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nashdev-level-up).

We'll try to organize the repo by topic, duplicating cross-cutting material as
necessary.

For each work, please provide:
  * Title
  * A [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink) to a page with either
    more information, buying options, or a legal copy of the source material
  * _Optionally_: A brief description of what you found valuable about the material
